### Why I've started working on v3
There are plenty of reasons behind this. But these are the main ones:

- We relied on proprietary software
- GML sucks
- Underlaying layer was a blackbox

### Aim of v3

- Engine build on top of MonoGame FW
- Tiled serves as primary room editor
- Implement as much of GMS pipeline into C# as possible
- Upgrade outdated concepts of GMS

### Status

**Done**
- Sprite
- Font

**WIP**
- Object (GameObject)

**TBD**
- Shader
- Timeline
- Path
- Room
