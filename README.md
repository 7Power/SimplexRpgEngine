## Why Simplex Engine 3
Ever worked with GameMaker: Studio? Simplex is aiming to provide a modern, modular, GM:S like environment. Define objects, override events, assign actions, place instances into the room editor. You know the drill. We are taking this intuitive workflow to the next level. Learn how. 

## Unique value
Room editor runs in 60 fps and all objects are equipped with an additional set of in-editor events. That means you can do anything right in the room editor. From simple stuff like changing ImageIndex on runtime to physical simulation. Anything, rendered via DirectX12, 3D accelerated.

## SGML aka GML++
Do you like Game Maker's scripting language as much as we do? So simple to use, right? We are taking GML where noone before - function by function we've implemented almost entire GML into C#, improving each and every function where possible. Ever wondered why draw_rectangle has no angle argument, why instance_find don't accept a predicate or why you can't set shape nor opacity of the game window? Use modern C# constructs and simple GML actions side by side.

## All the editors you are used to
Manage all your resources easily with our code, sprites, audio and room editor. Modern looking, dark themed, multi-display aware, ready for 8k forms. Several times faster project loading, using less memory and processing time, utilizing .net framework 4.8

## Every single inch modular
Ever wanted to modify right-click instance menu in the room editor? Pair automapping with masks generation, visually edit attributes? We hear you, taking all you know from GMS one step further. 

## Source control ready 
Develop in teams and fear of the merge conflicts not. Simple, efficient project structure allows for painless source control and continuous integration.
